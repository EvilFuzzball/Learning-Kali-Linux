Connecting to Bridged network:
- 	The host machine needs to connect to a network device that can give
	you an IP address via DHCP, such as a router or switch
-	DHCP is not a permanent address, eventually, you will have to renew it
-	Make the IP adress permanent -> save the IP address in /etc/network/interfaces
-	Make a network card bind the IP address premamently -> edit the file and change the content to the following:
	
	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
	address 10.0.2.15
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 10.0.2.0
	broadcast 10.0.2.255
	gateway 10.0.2.2
