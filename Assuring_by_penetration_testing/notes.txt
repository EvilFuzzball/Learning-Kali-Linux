Connecting to Bridged network:
- 	The host machine needs to connect to a network device that can give
	you an IP address via DHCP, such as a router or switch
-	DHCP is not a permanent address, eventually, you will have to renew it
-	Make the IP adress permanent -> save the IP address in /etc/network/interfaces
-	Make a network card bind the IP address premamently -> edit the file and change the content to the following:
	
	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
	address 10.0.2.15
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 10.0.2.0
	broadcast 10.0.2.255
	gateway 10.0.2.2
	
UPDATING LINUX FROM REPOSITORIES:
	Update Linux with these commands -> dkpg, apt, aptitude
	Search for a package name in a repository -> apt-cache search <package_name>
	Display package info -> apt-cache show <package_name>
	Install the package -> apt-get install <package_name>
	Installing from source code -> Usually works like this: ./configure -> make -> make installh
	
	
Nessus Vulnerability Scanner:
Start the program -> /etc/init.d/nessusd start

cisco_crack -> ./cisco_crack -h -> displayes how to user it
It cracks cisco7 passwords


Chapter 2: Penetration Testing Methodology

Pentest: The process that is followed to conduct an in-depth secutiry assessment or auduit
Methodology: Defines a set of rules, practices, or procedures that are implemented during the pentest
Penenetration testing methodololy: Defines a roadmap of ideas that can be followed to assess the true security posture of the target

Types of peneteration testing:
	
	Black Box:	Jump right into the penetration testing without further awareness of the technology.
				Apply real world hacking techniques to exploit the system. Prioritze the risks, write up a report.
	
	White Box:	The tester is aware of the system infrastructure and underlying technologies. Easier, and costs less thatn black box testing.
				Takes less effort and takes less exploits due to knowledge about the system.
	
	Vulnerability Assessment: 	Process to assess the internal and external securoty controls by identifying threats.
								It is good to keep track of up to date vulnerabilities in a VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
	
	Pentration testing VS Vulnerability Assesment:
		Pentetsing:		Goes more in deptch than Vulenrability Assessment. Hooks into the processes of EXPLOITATION, PRIVILEDGE ESCALATION and MAINTAINING ACCESS.
		Vulnerability Assessment:	Provides a broad view of existing flaws in the system without measuring the impact. 
									Less intrusive and aggressive than pentesting.
		Which to use? 
			Pentest when firewalls, instrusion dection systems, file integrity monitoring, ect are in doubt.
			Vulnerability scan when locating the vulnerabilities.
